Code Explanation

GUI Layout

The calculator window is created using Tk() from Tkinter and is set to a fixed size of 312x324.
The input field is an Entry widget where users can see the ongoing calculation.
The calculator buttons are created using Button widgets and organized into a grid layout.

Functions

btn_click(item): Adds a button's value to the expression string.
bt_clear(): Clears the current expression.
bt_equal(): Evaluates the expression and displays the result.

Button Functions

Each button calls the btn_click() function with the corresponding value (numbers or operators).
The clear button (C) triggers the bt_clear() function to reset the input field.
The equals button (=) triggers the bt_equal() function to compute the result using Pythonâ€™s eval() function.

Example

Press numbers and operators: 7, +, 3.
Press = to get the result: 10.
